            <h3>About me</h3>
                <p className="aboutText">I am a frontend developer that keeps to the KISS design principle. I love to learn anything that will improve my craft and incorporate <strong><em>any and all</em></strong> feedback.</p>
            <h3>Interests</h3>
                <p className="aboutText">I'm a nature loving solarpunk. I'm into taking care of my lizards and beetles, marching up mountains, and putting far too much effort into tending my compost. I squeeze in the occasional book or movie in when I can.</p>
            <h3>Why programming?</h3>
                <p className="aboutText">I have always dabbled in programming. One of my first memories is of taking a course on Basic way back when. When opportunity arose during my teaching career, I would use my beginner Python skills to automate the boring stuff.</p>
                <p className="aboutText">And then the pandemic changed everything. Teaching was comfortable, but there was no next step along that career path. I had to do a radical re-evaluation of what I wanted from my worklife. There was only one job in the venn diagram of "what I'm good at", "what I enjoy doing", and "what's employable": programming!</p>
